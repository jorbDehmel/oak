Acorn Version   | Date     | Justification
----------------|----------|------------------------------------
0.7.1           | 8/3/24   | Added implicit instantiation for
                |          | generic functions (exact matches
                |          | only). Also fixed warnings in most
                |          | tests about number literals.
                |          |
0.7.0           | 7/10/24  | Various bug fixes; Restricted
                |          | return types on copy further, fixed
                |          | bugs with return type checking.
                |          |
0.6.3           | 5/28/24  | Added serialization package
                |          | `cereal`.
                |          |

                |          | minor additions to `std` and test
                |          | suites.
                |          |

                |          | compliance to new rule system; Code
                |          | written before this likely will not
                |          | work. Also, integrated method call

                |          | a given translation unit. Also
                |          | changed protocol for `c_` family
                |          | of compile-time macros to be `c::`

0.4.25          | 2/8/24   | Added syntax errors prohibiting
                |          | trailing whitespace and requiring
                |          | comments. Reformatted provided
